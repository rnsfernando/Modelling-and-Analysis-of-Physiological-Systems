<h1>Analysis of Physiological Systems: Cardiac Physiology Assignment</h1>

<p>This repository contains the materials for an assignment on cardiac physiology focusing on normal cardiac rhythm and cardiac rhythm during aortic valve stenosis. The simulations are conducted using CircAdapt simulation software, which allows for the visualization and analysis of various hemodynamic parameters.</p>

<h2>Simulation Tasks</h2>

<h3>Normal Sinus Rhythm</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Visualize left ventricular pressure, left atrial pressure, aortic pressure, and left ventricular volume.</li>
  <li>Analyze blood flow velocities in the aortic and mitral valves.</li>
  <li>Examine the pressure-volume relationship of the left ventricle.</li>
  <li>Identify phases of the cardiac cycle and relate them to the Wiggers diagram.</li>
  <li>Investigate atrial pressure changes and correlate them with ECG waveforms.</li>
  <li>Calculate and interpret the E/A ratio of mitral blood flow.</li>
  <li>Estimate passive and active filling contributions to left ventricular volume.</li>
  <li>Understand the relationship between valve flow velocity patterns and valve anatomy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aortic Valve Stenosis (AS)</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Simulate varying degrees of aortic valve stenosis (up to 80% reduction).</li>
  <li>Evaluate hemodynamic changes, particularly in left ventricular pressure-volume relation.</li>
  <li>Analyze the effect of AS on preload, afterload, and cardiac output.</li>
  <li>Estimate maximal pressure drop across the stenotic valve using simplified Bernoulli's equation.</li>
  <li>Determine ejection duration and external pump work generated by the left ventricle.</li>
  <li>Discuss myocardial adaptation to increased pump work due to AS.</li>
</ul>
