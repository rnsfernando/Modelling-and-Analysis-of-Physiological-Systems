  <h1>Introduction to Hodgkin-Huxley Equations Simulation</h1>
  <p>This repository explores the properties of the Hodgkin-Huxley equations, a seminal model in neurophysiology that describes the generation and propagation of action potentials in neurons. Through MATLAB simulations, we investigate key physiological phenomena observed in neuronal membranes under various conditions.</p>
